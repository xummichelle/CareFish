#  CareFish

CareFish is a mood-tracking and to-do app where users build up an aquarium. Top 6 overall for Technova 2023. view the Devpost submission (includes Figma prototype) [here](https://devpost.com/software/carefish).

## Inspiration
Mood-tracking, journaling, and staying on top of tasks... All of these are important for your lifestyle and self-care, but it can be hard to organize, keep track, and stay motivated in all of this self-care work. As a result, keeping up with all these activities can be stressful and it can be hard to reap the benefits of all the hard work. [Studies](https://mhealth.jmir.org/2018/12/e11271/) have shown that smartphone apps are incredibly effective ways to bring mental health support and distress-reducing programs to users.

## What it does
CareFish is a mood-tracking and to-do app where users build up an aquarium. It is a simplified and gamified way to keep track of mood, journal entries, and daily tasks all in one, so users can easily work on their mental health without flipping between apps or other tools of choice. 

### Mood-tracking
The home screen features a calendar that users can click on to set their mood and a journal entry for each day. To keep with the fish theme, a different sea creature represents each emotion in the mood-tracking section of the app. When finished, the selected calendar day is updated with a colour representing the emotion for the day. The top of the home screen gives the user a motivational message to help give them some support.

### Aquarium
To help users stay motivated and keep the work fun, we added an aquarium decorating feature. As users track their mood every day, if they build up a streak, they unlock various pieces of decor to decorate their aquarium. Users know they can unlock a piece of furniture by the state of the treasure chest in the aquarium.

### Daily Tasks
A simple to-do list for simple daily tasks that the user can set. This is targeted for small tasks and reminders since small tasks can be difficult at times.



## How we built it
We developed Carefish using Swift, and used Git and GitHub for version control. The app UI and prototype were built using Figma. All icons and assets (fish, etc) were created using Adobe Illustrator. 

## Challenges we ran into
Both members of our team are beginners to Figma and Swift, thus learning these took a lot of hard work. Unfortunately, we ran out of time to complete all code functionality for the features we had planned. One issue that came up was learning how to pass data between screens. We looked into using Realm, but did not have enough time to use it in the app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're really proud of the idea/aquarium theme we came up with and our collaboration, especially during the ideation process. Changes in our ideas came up, but we worked through them smoothly. We split up the work fairly and enjoyed the share of the work we did. Building up a product and learning new tools from scratch weren't easy, but all the progress we made and the effort we put in were very rewarding. We're glad we got the opportunity to learn about Figma and Swift, which we can continue to use in future projects and in our careers.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about Figma prototyping, the design process, and component work. For Swift, learning the language, how to use Xcode, the ViewController lifecycle, and creating views in the storyboard and programmatically, were all new to us.

## What's next for CareFish
We plan to include the following:
- Complete functionality of mood tracking, aquarium decorating, and the to-do list. 
- Adding and designing more decor and fish.
- Increased accessibility with colour choices, labels, translating, text-to-speech, and more.
- Login for users to save their data.
